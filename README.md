# Algorithm With JavaScript

## general
1. binarySearch.js: Binary Search in JS.
2. mapWithReduce.js: map function created with reduce method.
3. variance.js: Variance algorithm in JS.
4. combinations: Get all possible combinations from given arr.
5. isPrime.js: dividing through 2 to root n, returns boolean result for number n whether prime or not.
### codewars
1. jadenCasingStrings.js: Make first letter in every words to be upper case.
1. unique_in_order.js: takes as argument a sequence 
and returns a list of items without any elements 
with the same value next to each other 
and preserving the original order of elements.
1. stringIncrementer.js: Your job is to write a function which increments a string, to create a new string. If the string already ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1. If the string does not end with a number the number 1 should be appended to the new string.

## sort
1. mergeSort.js: Sort algorithm that has time complexity of O(lgn). Uses divide and conquer.
